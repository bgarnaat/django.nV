## Reviewing nVisium Task manager

### Vulnerability 1:

#### Exposure:

We found an instance of SQL Injection by typing "testPic',(select password from auth_user where username='admin'),8);--" into "File Name".

By Exploiting this vulnerability we were able to retrieve the hashed database admin password from the bug report error page.


#### Repair:

views.py contained the vulnerability.  We were able to fix the first with the following adjustment(s):

#### views.py

USE ORM.  NOT DIRECT SQL.

using the file model, set name, path, and project_id attributes to values accepted from form input.  call the .save() method on this file object to commit to db.

```
file = File(name=name, path=upload_path, project_id=proj)
file.save()

 ```


### Vulnerability 2:

#### Exposure:

We found an instance of Broken Auth by typing the form object in HTML contained all fields commented out (superuser & staff checkboxes).  Uncommenting this block of code allows us to become the most powerful hackers in the world (sorry Dade).

By Exploiting this vulnerability we were able to login with super user credentials.


#### Repair:

forms.py contained the vulnerability.  We were able to fix the vulnerability  with the following adjustment(s):

#### forms.py
explicitly declare the fields to accept input from the form
```
fields = ['username', 'password', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email']
```


### Vulnerability 3:

#### Exposure:

We found an instance of XSS by updating username field of profile page to include <script> tags with JavaScript.

By Exploiting this vulnerability we were able to pop up an alert window on loading a page.  This could theoreticall be used to mine the database for login information of other users with proper syntax.


#### Repair:

base_backend.html contained the vulnerability.  We were able to fix this with the following adjustment(s):

#### base_backend.html
```
remove |safe from template fields.
```


### Vulnerability 4:

#### Exposure:

We found an instance of insecure DOR by typing project id's into the URL bar e.g. adding 8/8 to taskManager --> taskManager/8/8/.

By Exploiting this vulnerability we were able to a different user's project!  TAKE THAT NEWS.  - Dade waz here.


#### Repair:

views.py contained one or two similar vulnerabilities (like 10).  We were able to fix at least one with the following adjustment(s):

#### views.py
Change:
```
if request.method == 'POST':

to

if request.method == 'POST' and user.is_authenticated():
```


<!--

### Vulnerability _:

#### Exposure:

We found an instance of <attack> by typing <what did we type> into <some field or by doing some wierd edge-case thingy>.

By Exploiting this vulnerability we were able to retrieve <stuff> from the site / access to some unauthorized part of the site / something else valuable.


#### Repair:

problem_file1.py and problem_file2.py contained the vulnerability.  We were able to fix the first with the following adjustment(s):

#### problem_file1.py
```
some body of code solves our problem
```

#### problem_file2.py
```
some body of code solves our problem
``` -->
